## 💬 Sentiment Analysis App

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis App**, a user-friendly web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the sentiment of a given text (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) using a trained machine learning model.

### 📌 Overview

This project performs text sentiment classification using:

* **TF-IDF Vectorization**
* **Machine Learning Models**:

  * Random Forest
  * Logistic Regression (or another model from your notebook)

Users can input any sentence and get real-time sentiment predictions from the model of their choice.

### 🛠️ Features

✅ Predict sentiment of custom text
✅ Toggle between two trained models
✅ Real-time, interactive interface
✅ Clean and modern UI using Streamlit

### ⚙️ Installation & Running the App

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files.

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the local server URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser.

### 🧠 Models Used

* **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Transforms raw text into numerical features.
* **Random Forest Classifier**: Ensemble-based model for high accuracy.
* **Alternative Model**: Could be Logistic Regression, SVM, etc. (based on `sentiment_model.pkl`).

Would you like me to generate a sample `requirements.txt` as well or add a section about training the model from the notebook?
